## 🎯 Summary: Three Ways to Record Tests

### Option 1: Simplest - Windows Game Bar (Use This Now!)

**Best for:** Quick demos, immediate results, no code changes needed

```bash
# 1. Start recording
Win+Alt+R

# 2. Run test
flutter test integration_test/desktop_connection_test.dart -d windows

# 3. Stop recording
Win+Alt+R

# 4. Video automatically saved to:
# C:\Users\YourName\Videos\Captures\
```

**Pros:**

- ✅ High quality
- ✅ Works immediately

**Perfect for your no-code platform demo!**

---

### Option 2: Automated - FFmpeg (For Production)

**Best for:** CI/CD, automated testing, your platform backend

The code is already created in:
- `lib/test_helpers/screen_recorder.dart`
- `integration_test/recorded_desktop_connection_test.dart`

**Usage:**
```bash
flutter test integration_test/recorded_desktop_connection_test.dart -d windows
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fully automatic
- ✅ Programmatic control
- ✅ Works in CI/CD
- ✅ Can be triggered from backend

---

### Option 3: Professional - OBS Studio

**Best for:** Marketing videos, professional demos

```bash
# 1. Install OBS
choco install obs-studio

# 2. Configure output folder
# 3. Start recording in OBS
# 4. Run test
# 5. Stop recording in OBS
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide for Your Team

### For Developers (Testing Features):

```bash
# Method 1: Just run the app and test manually
flutter run -d windows
# Manually test: Create shapes → Connect them

# Method 2: Run automated test
flutter test integration_test/desktop_connection_test.dart -d windows
# Test runs automatically in 20 seconds
```

### For Demo/Stakeholders (Need Video):

```bash
# 1. Press Win+Alt+R (start recording)
# 2. Run: flutter run -d windows
# 3. Demonstrate: Create shapes, connect them, show all features
# 4. Press Win+Alt+R (stop recording)
# 5. Video is in: Videos\Captures\
# 6. Share video with team!
```

### For Your No-Code Platform Backend:

```typescript
// API endpoint to run test with video
app.post('/api/run-visual-test', async (req, res) => {
  const { testName, userId } = req.body;

  // 1. Start FFmpeg screen recording
  const ffmpeg = spawn('ffmpeg', [
    '-f', 'gdigrab',
    '-framerate', '30',
    '-i', 'desktop',
    '-t', '30', // 30 second limit
    '-c:v', 'libx264',
    '-preset', 'ultrafast',
    `temp_${testName}.mp4`
  ]);

  await sleep(2000); // Let recording start

  // 2. Run Flutter test
  const test = spawn('flutter', [
    'test',
    `integration_test/${testName}_test.dart`,
    '-d', 'windows'
  ]);

  await waitForProcess(test);

  // 3. Stop FFmpeg (send 'q')
  ffmpeg.stdin.write('q');
  await waitForProcess(ffmpeg);

  // 4. Upload to S3
  const videoUrl = await uploadToS3(`temp_${testName}.mp4`);

  // 5. Save to database
  await db.testRuns.create({
    userId,
    testName,
    videoUrl,
    status: 'passed',
    timestamp: new Date()
  });

  res.json({ success: true, videoUrl });
});
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Keep Videos Short
```dart
// Add timeouts to prevent long recordings
await tester.pumpAndSettle(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Not 30 seconds!
```

### 2. Add Visual Indicators
```dart
// Show what's being tested
print('🎯 Testing: Create rectangle');
await tester.tap(rectangleButton);
```

### 3. Compress Videos
```bash
# After recording, compress for web delivery
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx265 -crf 28 output.mp4
# Reduces file size by 50-70%
```

### 4. Generate Thumbnails
```bash
# Create preview image
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -ss 00:00:05 -vframes 1 thumbnail.png
```
